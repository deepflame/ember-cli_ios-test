# iOS-Test for Ember-cli

This is just a test repo for an issue I found with ember-cli and iOS.

## Issue

Build and run the app and open it. Both buttons will open a popup on a Desktop browser, on iOS the "Ember" button will not work.

### Tested with:

__working__

- Chrome 38 OSX Yosemite

__not working__

- iPhone 5 iOS 7.1 (Simulator)
- iPhone 5s iOS 8.1 (Simulator)
